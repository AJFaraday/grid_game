# Grid Game

That's right, there's no particular concept to it yet.

## What is the game?

* The game is played on a square grid.
* Each player has a colour, and starts with one city.
* Each players army marches in one direction at any one time.
* On periodical turns, every city sends one soldier in their players directionn.
* Every turn, each soldier takes one step in its players direction.
* When a soldier hits an obstacle, they stop.
* When a soldier meets another solder belonging to the same player, they team up.
* When 10 soldiers team up, they form a city.
