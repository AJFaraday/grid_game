# Grid Game

That's right, there's no particular concept to it yet.

## What is the game?

* The game is played on a square grid.
* Each player starts with one city, cities have 10 health.
* Each players army marches in one direction at any one time.
* On periodical turns, every city sends one soldier in their players directionn.
* Every turn, each soldier takes one step in its players direction.
* When a soldier hits an obstacle, they stop.
* When allied soldiers meet, they team up.
* When 10 soldiers team up, they form a city.
* Every turn, each soldier does one damage to each of its non-alied units or cities.
* One damage is enough to kill one soldier, or one tenth of a city.
* The game ends when only one player remains on the map.
