KotH: Bots to play the Grid Game


This is Grid Game (link)

(picture here)

It's a game based on celular automata, where the aim is to remove all of the pieces belonging to your oponent.


How it works:

* There are two kinds of piece in the game, cities and walkers.
* Each player starts with one City (marked with C and a number, which is it's health), which will regularly send out
walters (marked with a number, initially the number 1) in a given direction.
* The player can change the direction of all of their walkers to be north, south, east or west.
* When walkers can't go any further, they will stay still and can be joined by other walkers, increasing their number.
* When 10 walkers join up, they become another city.
* When walkers meet walkers or cities belonging to the opponent, they deal damage, reducing the number on these pieces
they've hit until they reach 0 and become inactive. This damage is dealt in both directions.
* There is no way to replenish the health of a city.
* The game ends when either player has no pieces remaining, or when a clear stale-mate is reached.

## The Challenge

To write a bot to play Grid Game, and defeat as many rival bots as possible.

* A bot is some code which will be run on each turn of the game.
* It can only be JavaScript, sorry.
* The size of the code is immaterial.
* An object named `api` will be provided as an interface to the player.
* In this iteration of the challenge, there is no way for your bot to know what it's opponent is doing.
The challenge is to write a proactive (not reactive) strategy.

## The API

* **api.turn** - Returns the numbered turn the game is on.
* **api.towardsX** - Aim your walkers towards the opponent on the East-West axis.
* **api.towardsY** - Aim your walkers towards the opponent on the North-South axis.
* **api.awayX** - Aim your walkers away from the opponent on the East-West axis.
* **api.awayY** - Aim your walkers away from the opponent on the North-South axis.
* **api.random_direction** - Aim you walkers in a randomly seelecttd direction.
* **api.north** - Aim your walkers North if you're in the top-left corner. Rotated for other player. Alias of awayY.
* **api.south** - Aim your walkers South if you're in the top-left corner. Rotated for other player. Alias of towardsY.
* **api.east** - Aim your walkers East if you're in the top-left corner. Rotated for other player. Alias of towardsX.
* **api.west** - Aim your walkers West if you're in the top-left corner. Rotated for other player. Alias of AwayX.

_Note:_ The last direction method called will define the next direction the walkers move in.

## How to write a bot

_Note:_ I recommend playing a manual game or two first; to do this, grab a friend to play against and
select 'Manual (simple)' in the footer.

* Go to https://ajfaraday.github.io/grid_game/
* Select a default bot as your base (in the green or red box)
* Click Edit Code in the same coloured box.
* Click Use when you're happy with it.

To test it:

* Select an opponent bot as the other colour (or 'Manual' if you'd like to challenge it yourself.
* Open the developer console (f12) in case of errors in your code.
* Click Start.
* Watch the game unfold.
* Click Reset and repeat the process as desired.

## How to deploy your bot

Once you've written a boss you'd like to keep:

* Go to https://gist.github.com
* Log in, if not already logged in.
* (The default page is the form to create a new gist, this is where we want to be.)
* Name the file 'bot.js'
* Copy the code into bot.js
* Save the gist
* Copy the gist ID (an alphanumeric string found after the last forward slash in the URL).

This Gist ID can now be used to import your bot into Grid Game at any time:

* Select Gist Id in a coloured box.
* Paste the ID into the field which appears.

You will need to include this gist ID in your answer

## Answer Format

Your answer will consist of:

* A Title, made up of a name for your bot and the gist ID
* A brief description of the bot's strategy.
* The code for your bot.
* Any notes you wish to include.

Example answer:

### The Faraday Cage - d9eb9a70ad0dc0fb1885be0fce032adc

The Faraday Cage is an arrangement of four cities in the player's starting corner, which
this bot will attempt to build, which then allows it to repeatedly send two 9's towards the opponent.

    if (api.turn() < 30) {
      api.awayY();
    } else if (api.turn() < 60) {
      api.awayX();
    } else {
      if (api.turn() % 54 < 27) {
        api.towardsY();
      } else {
        api.towardsX();
      }
    }

This is named after Alan Faraday, the elder brother of the game creator, who discovered it while playing the game manually.

It has proven difficult to defeat.

## The Tournament

In order to determine the challenge winner, bots will be placed in a bracket tournament which will be streamed
live, and recorded for posterity.

Pause points:

In tournament conditions, the game will pause automatically. First at turn 10,000 (around 1:40), then at 2,500 turn
intervals until there's a clear winner or turn 20,000 is reached.

Ending conditions:

* Outright win - 4 points - There are no opponent  pieces left on the board.
* Winning by numbers - 3 points - during any pause point a bot has a clear numerical advantage.
* Winning on points - 2 points - If there's no clear winner at turn 20,000 (past round 1), points from previous rounds may be used as a tie break.
* Draw - 1 point - If there's no clear winner at turn 20,000, a precise numeric count will be used to determine a winner. Best of these three metrics.
  * Number of cities
  * Number of cities + walkers
  * Overall health of active pieces
